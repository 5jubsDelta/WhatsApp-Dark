# WhatsApp Dark Contrasted

WhatsApp dark Contrasted is a simple dark style for WhatsApp Web.

## Notes

This is a fork of the original Style "WhatsApp Dark" by [SpartanJ](https://github.com/SpartanJ/), which can be accessed here: [WhatsApp-Dark Official Repo](https://github.com/SpartanJ/WhatsApp-Dark).

This is a mirror of the style [WhatsApp Dark Theme by Prognoz](https://userstyles.org/styles/142914/), with the High Contrast Changes, hosted in [userstyles.org](https://userstyles.org). And this repository will now be the official place to distribute the style, since userstyles is basically dead.

Also, the CSS is a monstruosity but it works. WhatsApp Web thankfully started using 
[CSS custom properties](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/CSS/--*) some time ago, but
almost all the old code is still in in the CSS, so many rules are just old code, I'm to lazy to
clean up that mess for the moment.

## Status

The actual status is just the change of some dark colors to the high contrasted Dark #000000

This will be improved for other layout "areas", in future versions. Fell free to contribute.
